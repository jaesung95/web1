<h2>WEB 이란 무엇인가? </h2>
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
 (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.
 [1][2] The resources of the WWW are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
 (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are published by a software application called a web server.
